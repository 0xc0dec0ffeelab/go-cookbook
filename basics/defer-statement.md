The `defer` statement in Go is a powerful tool for managing resource cleanup and ensuring certain operations are executed at the end of a function. This snippet explores common use cases for using `defer`.

## Basic Use of Defer

The `defer` statement delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. It's often used for cleanup tasks like closing files:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Create("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()

	_, err = f.WriteString("File content")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("File written successfully")
}
```

## Deferring Multiple Calls

Multiple `defer` statements are stacked and executed in last-in-first-out order, which is useful for managing multiple resources:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("Bob")
	defer fmt.Println("Alex")
	
	fmt.Println("Welcome")
}
```

Output:
```
Welcome
Alex
Bob
```

Each deferred call is pushed onto a stack and will be executed after the `main()` function completes, in reverse order.

## Defer in Functions

The `defer` statement can also be used within functions for various cleanups:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func process() {
	defer cleanup()

	fmt.Println("Processing...")
	// Simulate some processing.
}

func cleanup() {
	fmt.Println("Cleaning up resources.")
}

func main() {
	process()
}
```

This example guarantees that `cleanup` is always called, even if `process` panics unexpectedly.

## Best Practices

- Chain multiple `defer` statements to manage multiple resources, ensuring they're closed in the correct order.

## Common Pitfalls

- Be aware of potential performance issues: Calling `defer` incurs a small overhead in Go. In performance-critical inner loops, minimize its use.
- Deferred functions run after the surrounding function returns, which means if the function panics, deferred calls still execute.
- Capturing loop variables in deferred functions can lead to unexpected results; use function literals to capture variables correctly.

## Performance Tips

- Avoid using `defer` in tight loops to reduce performance overhead.
- For high-performance scenarios, consider alternatives to defer when resources can be explicitly managed without risking forgetfulness or leaks.
- Understand the order of execution for multiple deferred calls to avoid redundant operations, ensuring cleanup tasks complement each other efficiently.
