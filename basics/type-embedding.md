Type embedding in Go allows for composing types, providing a flexible way to build more complex abstractions without the tight coupling of traditional inheritance. It uses struct types or interfaces to embed fields or abstract methods, facilitating code reuse and composition.

## Basic Type Embedding

Here's a simple example of type embedding in Go using structs:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Animal struct {
	Name string
}

func (a *Animal) Speak() string {
	return "..."
}

type Dog struct {
	Animal
	Breed string
}

func main() {
	dog := Dog{Animal: Animal{Name: "Bobby"}, Breed: "Husky"}
	fmt.Printf("%s is a %s and says: %s\n", dog.Name, dog.Breed, dog.Speak())
}
```

In this example, the `Dog` struct embeds the `Animal` struct. This means `Dog` inherits the fields and methods of `Animal` and can add its own, such as `Breed`.

## Type Embedding with Interfaces

Type embedding can also be used with interfaces to create powerful abstractions:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Speaker interface {
	Speak() string
}

type Parrot struct{}

func (p Parrot) Speak() string {
	return "Hello!"
}

type Human struct{}

func (h Human) Speak() string {
	return "Hi!"
}

func saySomething(s Speaker) {
	fmt.Println(s.Speak())
}

func main() {
	parrot := Parrot{}
	human := Human{}
	
	saySomething(parrot)
	saySomething(human)
}
```

In this scenario, both `Parrot` and `Human` implement the `Speaker` interface, allowing `saySomething` to call their respective `Speak` methods interchangeably.

## Anonymous vs. Named Fields

When embedding types, Go supports both anonymous and named fields:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Engine struct {
	Power int
}

type Car struct {
	Engine // Embedded field (anonymous)
	Make   string
	EngineDetails Engine  // Named field
}

func main() {
	myCar := Car{Engine: Engine{Power: 150}, Make: "Tesla", EngineDetails: Engine{Power: 200}}
	fmt.Printf("Car Make: %s, Power: %d, Detailed Power: %d\n", myCar.Make, myCar.Power, myCar.EngineDetails.Power)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use type embedding to promote composition for better flexibility and code reuse.
- Make sure embedded types represent meaningful abstractions and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Common Pitfalls

- Avoid tight coupling by embedding types that are not cohesive or logically related.
- Be cautious with field and method name collisions when embedding multiple types.
- Understand that type embedding implies sharing method sets, which might affect package design and testability.

## Performance Tips

- Take advantage of method reuse through embedding to reduce redundant code and minimize function call overhead.
- Utilize interfaces sensibly; while they add flexibility, interfaces might introduce minor runtime costs associated with dynamic dispatch.
