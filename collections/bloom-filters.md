Bloom filters are space-efficient probabilistic data structures designed to test whether an element is a member of a set. Their efficiency comes at the cost of allowing false positives but not false negatives. In Go, the "github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom/v3" library is a popular choice for working with Bloom filters.

## Basic Bloom Filter Usage

First, install the package:

```sh
go get github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom/v3
```

Here's an example of creating and using a Bloom filter:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom/v3"
)

func main() {	
	n := uint(2048)         // Expected number of items.
	fp := 0.02              // False positive probability.
	
	filter := bloom.NewWithEstimates(n, fp)

	// Add items to the filter.
	filter.Add([]byte("user123"))
	filter.Add([]byte("user456"))
	
	testItems := []string{"user123", "user456", "user789"}

	for _, item := range testItems {
		if filter.Test([]byte(item)) {
			fmt.Printf("%s possibly in set\n", item)
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("%s definitely not in set\n", item)
		}
	}
}
```

## Configuring Bloom Filter

There are multiple ways to configure a Bloom filter:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/bits-and-blooms/bloom/v3"
)

func main() {
	// Create a Bloom filter with custom number of hashes and bits.
	m := uint(15000) // Number of bits.
	k := uint(7)     // Number of hash functions.

	// Create a Bloom filter using the configured parameters.
	filter := bloom.New(m, k)

	// Add and test items.
	filter.Add([]byte("product123"))
	if filter.Test([]byte("product123")) {
		fmt.Println("product123 possibly in set")
	}
}
```

## Best Practices

- Carefully set the expected number of items and false positive probability when initializing. These impact the efficiency and accuracy of the Bloom filter.
- Use Bloom filters when the set operations (insert and membership test) are frequent and the space efficiency is critical.
- Periodically verify the false positive rate to ensure it meets application requirements.

## Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring hash function count and bit array size can lead to inefficient or inaccurate Bloom filters.
- Misunderstanding false positives: Bloom filters can confirm item presence incorrectly but never a false absence.
- Missing library updates: Regularly check the library for updates as optimizations or bug fixes might be available.

## Performance Tips

- Profile your application to balance the space consumption (`m`) and the number of hash functions (`k`) for optimal performance.
- Use byte slices directly as keys to avoid unnecessary allocations and conversions.
- Consider using other data structures if membership tests need to be absolutely accurate without the acceptance of false positives.
