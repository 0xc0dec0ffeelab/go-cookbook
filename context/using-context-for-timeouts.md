The Go programming language provides the `context` package that offers a way to handle timeouts in your applications. This is crucial for cases where you want to prevent a function from hanging indefinitely by enforcing a deadline.

## Basic Timeout with Context

Using `context.WithTimeout` function, you can specify a timeout period for your operations, helping your application manage resources efficiently.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func performOperation(ctx context.Context) {
	select {
	case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Operation completed")
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
	}
}

func main() {
	// Set timeout of 1 second.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)
	defer cancel() // Ensure resources are released.

	performOperation(ctx)
}
```

## Using Context in HTTP Client

Applying context with timeouts can be especially useful when making HTTP requests, as it allows you to cancel the request if it takes too long.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, "https://httpbin.org/delay/5", nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	client := &http.Client{}
	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Request error:", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Read error:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always use `defer` to ensure `cancel()` is called to release resources even if timeout is reached.
- Use specific contexts for long-running operations vs. one global context. This helps in better management and scalability.
- Integrate context timeouts with existing code by passing `ctx` to functions and methods.

## Common Pitfalls

- Not calling the `cancel()` function which leads to context resources not being freed.
- Using context timeouts incorrectly by setting them either too short or too long, which can result in unnecessary failures or resource wastage.
- Failing to respect the `Done` channel in long-running operations.

## Performance Tips

- For higher performance in high-load systems, consider setting a dynamic timeout based on early profiling or benchmarks.
- Context can be utilized to propagate deadlines and cancellation signals across goroutines efficiently, reducing the need for additional synchronization objects.
- Properly tune timeouts for your application workflow to balance between responsiveness and completion of lengthy operations.
