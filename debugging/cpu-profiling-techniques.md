CPU profiling in Go helps developers understand where their application spends most of its execution time, enabling them to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance effectively. The standard library's `pprof` package provides built-in support for CPU profiling in Go applications.

## Basic CPU Profiling

You can enable CPU profiling in a Go application using the `runtime/pprof` package. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to start and stop CPU profiling programmatically within your code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"runtime/pprof"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Create("cpu.prof")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not create CPU profile:", err)
		return
	}
	defer f.Close()

	if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start CPU profile:", err)
		return
	}
	defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()

	// Simulate workload.
	for i := 0; i < 1000000; i++ {
		fmt.Sprint(i)
	}

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Ensure some CPU activity is sampled
}
```

## Analyzing CPU Profiles

After generating a CPU profile, use the `go tool pprof` command to analyze it:

```bash
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

Once in the interactive shell, some useful commands include:

- `top`: Shows the top functions consuming CPU.
- `list <func>`: Displays code annotated with CPU usage for a specific function.
- `web`: Generates a visual graph of the CPU usage, usually opening it in the web browser.

## Using HTTP Server for Profiling

For web applications, integrate an HTTP server to expose profiling interfaces:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	_ "net/http/pprof"
)

func main() {
	// Add your application code here.

	log.Println("Starting HTTP server on :8080")
	log.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

By starting an HTTP server, you can access profiling data via `http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/`.

## Best Practices

- Ensure to stop the CPU profile using `defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()` to prevent file corruption.
- Use real workloads to capture realistic profiling data.
- Keep profiling sections as narrow as possible to reduce noise and focus analysis on critical paths.

## Common Pitfalls

- Profiling affects performance; avoid running profiles in production unless necessary.
- Incorrectly starting or stopping the profile can lead to incomplete or corrupt data.
- Not specifying workloads may lead to the profiler capturing idle CPU time, which is less useful.

## Performance Tips

- Focus on high-impact code paths; small gains in frequently executed parts can lead to significant improvements.
- Use the temporary HTTP profiling server during development to avoid modifying application code for profiling.
- Combine CPU profiling with other profiling types, such as memory, for comprehensive performance analysis.
- Profile different scenarios to ensure optimizations do not negatively affect other parts of the application.
