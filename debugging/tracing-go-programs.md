Tracing is an essential technique for understanding the execution flow of a program, and Go provides robust support for it through its standard library and tooling.

## Basic Tracing with the `runtime/trace` Package

The `runtime/trace` package allows you to capture execution traces of your Go program. Here's an example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"runtime/trace"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Create("trace.out")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer f.Close()

	if err := trace.Start(f); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer trace.Stop()

	// Your function or method calls that you want to trace.
	fmt.Println("Tracing this program...")
}
```

To examine the trace, use the tool provided by the Go distribution:

```bash
go tool trace trace.out
```

## Advanced Usage with HTTP Tracing

If you want to trace a Go server application, you can enable HTTP tracing:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	_ "net/http/pprof"
	"os"
	"runtime/trace"
)

func main() {
	go func() {
		log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
	}()

	log.Println("Starting application...")
	
	f, err := os.Create("http-trace.out")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()

	err = trace.Start(f)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer trace.Stop()

	// Simulate processing.
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		log.Printf("Processing %d\n", i)
	}
}
```

Then you can access profiling data via `http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/` and stop tracing through the same URL.

## Best Practices

- Always properly stop tracing using `trace.Stop()` to ensure trace data is not incomplete.
- Use `http/pprof` in conjunction with tracing for a more thorough analysis in server applications.
- Keep traces short and focused on problematic sections to minimize overhead.
- Regularly analyze the collected trace data to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Rotate trace files if you have a long-running application to prevent large files.

## Common Pitfalls

- Neglecting to close the trace file, which can result in incomplete traces.
- Starting trace without stopping it appropriately which leaves the tracing running indefinitely.
- Ignoring the performance overhead trace might introduce; use it judiciously in production.
- Overlapping traces can lead to confusing outputs when analyzed.
- Not specifying the correct path for the trace output file can lead to failures in data capture.

## Performance Tips

- Limit the tracing scope to specific areas of the application to reduce performance impact.
- Analyze trace files offline to limit intra-application communication overheads during analysis.
- Use sampling techniques to trace large-scale applications efficiently.
- Consider alternative profiling techniques to gather additional insights into application performance.
- Regularly update Go tools to take advantage of optimizations and new features in tracing utilities.
