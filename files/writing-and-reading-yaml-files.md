YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a widely-used format for configuration files. The Go language can handle YAML files using the external `go-yaml` package, which is a popular and efficient choice for this purpose.

## Writing YAML Files

To write YAML files in Go, you'll first need to install the `go-yaml` package. Use the following command to do so:

```sh
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v3
```

Here's a basic example of how to marshal Go data structures into a YAML file:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
	"os"
)

type Config struct {
	Name  string `yaml:"name"`
	Age   int    `yaml:"age"`
	Skill string `yaml:"skill"`
}

func main() {
	config := Config{Name: "John Doe", Age: 30, Skill: "Golang"}

	file, err := os.Create("config.yaml")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	encoder := yaml.NewEncoder(file)
	err = encoder.Encode(&config)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("YAML data written to file")
}
```

## Reading YAML Files

Reading YAML files is equally straightforward. You can unmarshal the data back into your struct:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
)

type Config struct {
	Name  string `yaml:"name"`
	Age   int    `yaml:"age"`
	Skill string `yaml:"skill"`
}

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("config.yaml")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(file)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	var config Config
	err = yaml.Unmarshal(data, &config)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("YAML data: %+v\n", config)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always check for errors at each step of file manipulation to handle any potential issues gracefully.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to close files using `defer`, which can cause file descriptor leaks.
- Not handling potential unmarshalling errors gracefully, which can lead to unmapped or missing data.
- Using inappropriate YAML tags, which can result in improper field mappings.

## Performance Tips

- For configurations read frequently but rarely change, consider caching the parsed YAML data in memory.
- Avoid excessive reads by keeping the file open only as long as necessary.
- Only read what's necessary; for very large configurations, consider breaking them into manageable pieces.
