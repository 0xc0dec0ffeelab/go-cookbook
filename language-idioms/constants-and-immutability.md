In Go, constants are used to define immutable values that remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program. This is particularly useful for values that are repeated and do not change, such as mathematical constants, fixed strings, or configuration values.

## Defining Constants

Here's a simple example of how to define constants in Go.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

const Pi = 3.14
const Greeting = "Hello, World!"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Pi:", Pi)
	fmt.Println(Greeting)
}
```

## Grouping Constants

Go allows you to group constants using the `const` block for better organization. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

const (
	MaxRetries = 5
	APIEndpoint = "https://api.example.com"
	DefaultTimeout = 30 // seconds
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("MaxRetries:", MaxRetries)
	fmt.Println("APIEndpoint:", APIEndpoint)
	fmt.Println("DefaultTimeout:", DefaultTimeout)
}
```

## Enumerated Constants

Go also provides a way to create enumerated constants using the `iota` keyword. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

const (
	Sunday = iota
	Monday
	Tuesday
	Wednesday
	Thursday
	Friday
	Saturday
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Sunday?", Sunday)
	fmt.Println("Monday?", Monday)
	fmt.Println("Saturday?", Saturday)
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Group Related Constants**: Use a `const` block to group related constants together for better readability and organization.
- **Use Enumerations for Logical Grouping**: Utilize `iota` for creating enumerated sequences which represent related constant values.
- **Limit Scope**: Define constants in the smallest scope necessary to reduce the potential for conflicts and improve code readability.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misusing Constants for Mutable Values**: Avoid using constants for values that might need to change. Use variables instead for mutable values.
- **Inefficient Value Assignments**: Be cautious when assigning constants to variables unnecessarily, as this may impact performance and cause confusion.

## Performance Tips

- **Minimize Repeated Calculations**: Utilize constants for values that are expensive to calculate and used repeatedly in your program.
- **Avoid Redeclaring Constants with the Same Value**: To reduce memory usage, avoid defining multiple constants with the same value. Instead, use the existing constant wherever applicable.
