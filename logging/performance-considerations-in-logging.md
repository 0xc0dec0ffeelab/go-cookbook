When implementing logging in your Go application, it's crucial to consider performance implications to ensure that logging doesn't become a bottleneck. The standard library's `log` package offers fundamental features that can be optimized for better performance.

## Basic Logging Setup

Here's a basic logging setup using the `log` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	logFile, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open log file: %v", err)
	}
	defer logFile.Close()

	logger := log.New(logFile, "INFO: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
	logger.Println("Application started")
	logger.Println("Another log entry")
}
```

## Optimized Logging with Customized Flags

Consider customizing log flags to balance verbosity and performance. Too much detailed logging can degrade performance.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	logFile, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open log file: %v", err)
	}
	defer logFile.Close()

	logger := log.New(logFile, "DEBUG: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)
	logger.Println("Optimized logging without excessive details")
}
```

## Advanced Logging with a Third-Party Library

For more advanced needs, consider using a third-party library like `logrus` or `zap`. `zap` is known for its performance efficiency:

```go
package main

import (
	"go.uber.org/zap"
)

func main() {
	logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
	defer logger.Sync() // Flushes buffer, if any

	logger.Info("Application started",
		zap.String("module", "main"),
		zap.Int("initPhase", 1),
	)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use structured logging formats like JSON for better parsing and indexing.
- Separate logging configuration from application logic; this facilitates changes without disruptively altering code.
- Limit the quantity of log output in high-load areas of the application to avoid performance degradation.

## Common Pitfalls

- Avoid logging excessively (e.g., inside tight loops), which can lead to I/O bottlenecks.
- Omitting deferred file closure, potentially leading to resource leaks.
- Neglecting error handling in setups, which might leave logging inoperable in deployment.

## Performance Tips

- Use buffered writers to improve the efficiency of disk writes.
- Consider asynchronous logging to handle heavy log loads without blocking operations.
- Profile your logging configuration in production-like environments to fine-tune settings for optimal performance.
- Evaluate log level need dynamically, possibly setting different levels in development and production for minimal output.
  
By adhering to these practices and techniques, your logging implementation will be both efficient and effective.
