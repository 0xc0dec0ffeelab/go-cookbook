Environment variables are a fundamental part of configuring applications, allowing developers to pass configuration parameters external to the application source code. This guide focuses on reading environment variables in Go, making your applications more flexible and secure.

## Basic Reading of Environment Variables

Go provides a straightforward way to read environment variables using the `os` package. Here's how you can read a single environment variable:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	value, exists := os.LookupEnv("MY_ENV_VAR")
	if !exists {
		fmt.Println("Environment variable MY_ENV_VAR not set")
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("The value of MY_ENV_VAR is %s\n", value)
	}
}
```

## Setting Default Values

It's a good practice to set a default value if an environment variable isn't set:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func getenv(key string, defaultValue string) string {
	if value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key); exists {
		return value
	}
	return defaultValue
}

func main() {
	value := getenv("MY_ENV_VAR", "default_value")
	fmt.Printf("The value is %s\n", value)
}
```

## Reading Multiple Environment Variables

For applications requiring several configuration settings, you can read multiple environment variables and handle their defaults:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	envVars := []string{"DB_HOST", "DB_PORT", "DB_USER", "DB_PASS"}

	for _, env := range envVars {
		value := os.Getenv(env)
		if value == "" {
			fmt.Printf("Warning: %s is not set\n", env)
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("%s = %s\n", env, value)
		}
	}
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Use `os.LookupEnv`:** This method returns a boolean indicating whether the environment variable is set, which is superior for determining if variables exist or not.
- **Default Values:** Always provide sensible defaults to ensure the application operates as expected in different environments.
- **Configuration Management:** Consider using a configuration management tool or library for large applications to load environment variables efficiently.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Case Sensitivity:** Environment variables are case-sensitive, which can cause issues if the wrong case is used when querying them.
- **Non-existent Variables:** Be cautious of using `os.Getenv` directly without checking for empty strings if the variable isn't set.

## Performance Tips

- **Environment Variable Load Order:** Minimize repetitive calls to `os.Getenv` by storing the results in variables at the start of your application, especially if reused frequently.
- **Avoid Hardcoding:** Avoid hardcoding environment variable names throughout your code for better maintainability. Use constants for environment variable keys.
- **Batch Processing:** If you need multiple environment variables, read them all at once at application startup rather than on-demand to reduce overhead.
