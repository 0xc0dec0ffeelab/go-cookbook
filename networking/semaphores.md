Semaphores are synchronization primitives used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in concurrent programming. In Go, semaphores can be efficiently implemented using buffered channels. This snippet shows how to create and use semaphores for various concurrency control scenarios.

## Basic Semaphore Implementation

Here's how you can implement a simple semaphore using a buffered channel:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Create a semaphore with a capacity for 3 concurrent routines.
	sem := make(chan struct{}, 3)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Function that simulates work.
	doWork := func(id int) {
		defer wg.Done()
		sem <- struct{}{}    // Acquire a slot
		defer func() { <-sem }() // Release a slot

		fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is working\n", id)
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate work by sleeping
		fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is done\n", id)
	}

	// Launch 5 goroutines.
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go doWork(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

## Advanced Semaphore Usage

This example illustrates how to use a semaphore for controlling the number of concurrent file downloads:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"sync"
)

func downloadFile(url string, sem chan struct{}, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	sem <- struct{}{}    // Acquire a slot
	defer func() { <-sem }() // Release a slot
	
	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to download %s: %v\n", url, err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	fmt.Printf("Downloaded %s with status code: %d\n", url, resp.StatusCode)
}

func main() {
	urls := []string{
		"http://example.com/file1",
		"http://example.com/file2",
		"http://example.com/file3",
		"http://example.com/file4",
		"http://example.com/file5",
	}
	
	sem := make(chan struct{}, 2)  // Semaphore for limiting to 2 concurrent downloads
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	
	for _, url := range urls {
		wg.Add(1)
		go downloadFile(url, sem, &wg)
	}
	
	wg.Wait()
}
```

## Best Practices

- Make sure to always release the semaphore to prevent deadlocks.
- Use buffered channels to implement semaphores, with the buffer size representing the maximum number of concurrent operations.
- Wrap semaphore acquisition and release operations in `defer` to manage lifecycle automatically and reduce the risk of human error.

## Common Pitfalls

- Not releasing the semaphore can lead to a deadlock where no new operations can proceed.
- Forgetting to close the channel can result in resource leakage over long program runs.
- Setting an inappropriate buffer size may not achieve the desired level of concurrency, either imposing too strict or too lenient limits.

## Performance Tips

- Opt for semaphore usage over other primitives like mutexes when dealing with independent, concurrent tasks that require throttling.
- Balance semaphore capacity according to the workload and available system resources to maximize throughput without overwhelming the system.
- Profile semaphore-controlled applications to find bottlenecks and adjust the semaphore size accordingly to achieve optimal performance.
