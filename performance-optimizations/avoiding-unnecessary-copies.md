Efficient memory usage is critical for high-performance applications. In Go, it's important to manage data copies carefully to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and increase performance.

## Avoiding Unnecessary String Copies

When manipulating strings, avoid unnecessary copies by using `byte` slices. The following example demonstrates converting a string to uppercase without creating duplicate strings:

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	str := "hello, world!"
	buf := bytes.NewBufferString(str)
	buf.WriteString(" Additional text.")

	// Use the buffer's bytes directly.
	fmt.Println(strings.ToUpper(string(buf.Bytes())))
}
```

## Avoiding Slice Copies

When working with slices, you can avoid copies by using them efficiently. Here's how:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

	// Pass slice directly without a copy.
	processSlice(numbers[:2])
	
	// Extend the slice without copy.
	modified := append(numbers, 6, 7)
	fmt.Println(modified)
}

func processSlice(s []int) {
	for _, v := range s {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}
```

## In-Place Operations for Memory Efficiency

Perform operations in-place when possible to avoid creating new copies of data structures:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"golang.org/x/exp/slices"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{5, 3, 4, 1, 2}

	// Sort in-place.
	slices.Sort(numbers)

	fmt.Println("Sorted:", numbers)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Be mindful of copying when passing structs to functions; prefer passing pointers to large structs.
- Use in-place algorithms to modify existing data structures rather than creating new copies.
- Profile your application to identify hotspots where copying is affecting performance.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overusing slice re-slicing can unexpectedly keep large arrays in memory.
- Copying data between slices and strings can lead to unnecessary memory allocations.
- Forgetting that modifying a slice also modifies the underlying array, leading to unintended side effects.

## Performance Tips

- Use the `bytes.Buffer` for efficient string concatenation to avoid multiple allocations.
- Profile your code using tools like `pprof` to spot unnecessary memory copies.
- For performance-critical code, consider using third-party libraries like `github.com/jinzhu/copier` for efficient data copying where needed.
