Maps in Go are built-in data structures that provide a convenient way to store and manipulate a collection of key/value pairs. This guide offers code snippets to help you understand how to use maps effectively within your Go applications.

## Basic Map Usage

Here's a simple example illustrating how to create, initialize, and manipulate a map:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Creating a map with string keys and integer values.
	ages := make(map[string]int)
	
	// Adding key/value pairs.
	ages["Alice"] = 30
	ages["Bob"] = 25
	
	// Retrieving a value.
	fmt.Println("Alice's age:", ages["Alice"]) // Output: Alice's age: 30
	
	// Deleting a key.
	delete(ages, "Alice")
	fmt.Println("Alice's age after deletion:", ages["Alice"]) // Output: Alice's age after deletion: 0
	
	// Checking if a key exists.
	if age, ok := ages["Bob"]; ok {
		fmt.Println("Bob's age:", age) // Output: Bob's age: 25
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Bob not found")
	}
}
```

## Iterating Over Maps

Go provides an easy way to iterate over maps using the `for` loop. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ages := map[string]int{
		"Charlie": 40,
		"Dave":    35,
		"Eve":     45,
	}
	
	// Iterating over map using for loop.
	for name, age := range ages {
		fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
	}
}
```

## Maps with Structs

Maps in Go can store complex values, including structs, which can be useful in various scenarios:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	people := make(map[string]Person)
	
	// Creating structs and adding them to the map.
	people["Alice"] = Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
	people["Bob"] = Person{Name: "Bob", Age: 25}
	
	// Accessing struct values from the map.
	alice := people["Alice"]
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", alice.Name, alice.Age)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use `make()` to create maps for better performance and code clarity.
- Always check if a key exists with the `value, ok := map[key]` pattern to prevent unexpected results.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to check for the existence of a key when accessing map values can lead to zero values being returned.
- Modifying maps concurrently without proper synchronization can lead to runtime panics. Use sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex to manage concurrent map access.
- Assuming that iteration over map keys/values is ordered, which it is not in Go.

## Performance Tips

- Pre-sizing the map with `make(map[KeyType]ValueType, initialSize)` can improve performance when the size is known in advance.
- For read-heavy use-cases, consider using `sync.Map`, which can be more efficient in concurrent scenarios at the cost of some write performance.
- Maps are reference types; copying a map only copies the header, so manipulate the original when passed around functions to avoid unintended modifications.
