The `os` package in Go provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality, such as file and directory manipulation, environment variable access, and process control. This guide will showcase some basic and advanced usage of the `os` package.

## Basic File Operations

Here's an example demonstrating how to open, read from, and close a file using the `os` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	buffer := make([]byte, 100)
	for {
		n, err := file.Read(buffer)
		if err == io.EOF {
			break
		}
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		fmt.Printf(string(buffer[:n]))
	}
}
```

## Handling Environment Variables

The `os` package provides ways to get and set environment variables. Here's how you can access and modify them:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Get an environment variable.
	path := os.Getenv("PATH")
	fmt.Println("Path:", path)

	// Set an environment variable.
	err := os.Setenv("MY_VAR", "my_value")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	value := os.Getenv("MY_VAR")
	fmt.Println("MY_VAR:", value)
}
```

## Working with Directories

Managing directories is straightforward with the `os` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new directory.
	err := os.Mkdir("newdir", 0755)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Remove a directory.
	err = os.Remove("newdir")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Directory created and deleted successfully!")
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always check for errors after calling functions from the `os` package and handle them appropriately.
- Use `defer` to ensure files are closed once they are no longer needed to avoid resource leaks.
- Be cautious about setting environment variables, as this affects the entire process.

## Common Pitfalls

- Not checking for errors from `os` operations, leading to unpredictable behavior and crashes.
- Forgetting to close files can lead to file descriptor leaks.
- Ignoring platform-specific behaviors, such as file path separators (`/` vs `\`).

## Performance Tips

- Minimize disk I/O by reading data in larger chunks where possible.
- Cache frequently accessed environment variables instead of using `os.Getenv()` repeatedly.
- Leverage goroutines for parallel file processing if the operation is CPU-bound.
