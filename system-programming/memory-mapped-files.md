Memory-mapped files allow file contents to be mapped to memory, enabling efficient I/O operations without explicit read and write calls. This technique is particularly useful for large files as it provides fast and easy access to file data. In Go, you can leverage the `golang.org/x/exp/mmap` package to work with memory-mapped files.

## Basic Memory-Mapped File Reading

Here's an example that demonstrates how to read a file using memory mapping with the `mmap.ReaderAt`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"golang.org/x/exp/mmap"
)

func main() {
	reader, err := mmap.Open("largefile.dat")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to open file: %v", err)
	}
	defer reader.Close()

	// Read a portion of the file.
	buf := make([]byte, 128)
	_, err = reader.ReadAt(buf, 0)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to read data: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("File content: %s\n", string(buf))
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Choose Suitable Scenarios**: Use memory-mapped files for large, read-heavy data to benefit from efficient access patterns.
- **Error Handling**: Always check and handle errors when dealing with file operations to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Defer Close**: Always defer the `Close()` method on `mmap.ReaderAt` to ensure resources are released after use.
- **Slice Management**: Manage slices carefully to avoid memory leaks or out-of-bounds errors when accessing the mapped file.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Resource Management**: Forgetting to close the memory-mapped file can lead to resource leaks.
- **Concurrent Access**: Be cautious with concurrent write operations, as memory mapping may not offer atomic updates or lock management automatically.
- **Platform Limitations**: Be aware that memory-mapped file behaviors might differ across operating systems.

## Performance Tips

- **Access Patterns**: Design access patterns where larger sequential reads are preferred to benefit from memory mapping.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage, especially when working with substantial files that can lead to high memory consumption.
- **Profiling**: Regularly profile your application to understand the impact on performance when using memory-mapped files in critical paths.

By effectively leveraging memory-mapped files, you can improve the efficiency of file access, particularly for applications dealing with substantial file sizes where performance gains are critical.
