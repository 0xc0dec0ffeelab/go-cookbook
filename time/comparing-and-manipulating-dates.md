Go provides a rich set of functionalities for handling dates and times through the `time` package. This snippet demonstrates how to compare and manipulate dates.

## Comparing Dates

You can compare two `time.Time` values using comparison operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	date1 := time.Date(2023, time.March, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
	date2 := time.Now()

	if date1.Before(date2) {
		fmt.Println("date1 is before date2")
	} else if date1.After(date2) {
		fmt.Println("date1 is after date2")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("date1 and date2 are the same")
	}
}
```

## Manipulating Dates

You can add or subtract durations from `time.Time` values using methods like `Add` or `AddDate`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	date := time.Now()

	// Add 5 days.
	futureDate := date.AddDate(0, 0, 5)
	fmt.Println("5 days from now:", futureDate)

	// Subtract 3 hours.
	pastDate := date.Add(-3 * time.Hour)
	fmt.Println("3 hours ago:", pastDate)
}
```

## Calculating Duration Between Dates

Calculate the duration between two dates using the `Sub` method.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()
	end := start.Add(48 * time.Hour)

	duration := end.Sub(start)
	fmt.Printf("Duration between start and end is %v hours\n", duration.Hours())
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use UTC for comparing dates and handling time zones to avoid errors caused by local time changes (e.g., DST).
- Always handle possible errors when parsing time strings.
- Use `time.Parse` with a consistent date layout to avoid parsing errors.
- Consider using the `time.Duration` for any arithmetic between dates.

## Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring time zones when comparing dates can lead to incorrect results.
- Not accounting for Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes if using local times.
- Using incorrect format strings in `time.Parse` or `time.Format` leading to incorrect parsing or formatting.
- Forgetting to consider months with different days when using `AddDate`.

## Performance Tips

- Avoid repeated parsing of time strings by caching parsed `time.Time` when applicable.
- Use the `time.Timer` or `time.Ticker` for repeated time-sensitive tasks instead of sleep loops.
- Profile code where date manipulation is frequent to ensure there arenâ€™t unnecessary conversions or operations.
