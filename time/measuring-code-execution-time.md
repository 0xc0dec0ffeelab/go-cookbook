Measuring code execution time is critical for performance analysis and optimization in Go. The `time` package in the standard library provides simple tools to achieve this.

## Basic Timing with time.Now()

The simplest way to measure execution time in Go is by recording start and end timestamps using `time.Now()`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Code to measure.
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

	duration := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Execution time: %v\n", duration)
}
```

## Using time.Since()

The `time.Since()` function is a convenient way to calculate the duration since a specific start time:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func longRunningTask() {
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
}

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	longRunningTask()

	fmt.Printf("Task completed in %v\n", time.Since(start))
}
```

## Creating a Timer Function

Create a reusable timer function to encapsulate measuring logic:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func measureExecutionTime(name string, f func()) {
	start := time.Now()
	f()
	fmt.Printf("%s executed in %v\n", name, time.Since(start))
}

func exampleTask() {
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func main() {
	measureExecutionTime("exampleTask", exampleTask)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use `defer` to ensure end time logging, which automatically happens at the end of the function lifecycle.
- Name your measurements meaningfully to make logs and metrics more informative.
- Use higher resolution time when precision is necessary, such as for micro-benchmarks.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to call `time.Since(start)` which leads to incorrect duration calculation.
- Overusing profiling in production environments, which can affect performance.
- Ignoring variance and statistical significance when evaluating repeated measurements.

## Performance Tips

- Where high-frequency timing is unnecessary, use lower-resolution durations to save CPU cycles.
- For benchmarking, prefer `testing.Benchmark` method to carry out automated and reliable performance tests.
- Be mindful of benchmarking in a controlled environment to reduce noise from other system activities.
