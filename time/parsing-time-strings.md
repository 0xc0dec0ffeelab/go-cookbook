Parsing time strings is a common task in Go, and it's efficiently supported by the built-in `time` package. This guide will show you how to parse time strings in different formats.

## Basic Time Parsing

The `time` package provides `time.Parse` for parsing time strings. The time layout must match the string format exactly.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	layout := "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
	timeStr := "2025-03-24T14:45:00Z"

	parsedTime, err := time.Parse(layout, timeStr)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Parsed time:", parsedTime)
}
```

## Parsing Time with Custom Formats

Go uses a specific reference time format called "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006" to recognize layouts. Each component serves as a placeholder.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// The reference time format must be used to write the layout.
	layout := "2006/01/02 3:04PM (MST)"
	timeStr := "2025/03/24 2:45PM (UTC)"

	parsedTime, err := time.Parse(layout, timeStr)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Parsed time:", parsedTime)
}
```

## Parsing with time zones

Handling different time zones can be done using `time.ParseInLocation`, which allows you to specify the location.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	location, err := time.LoadLocation("America/New_York")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error loading location:", err)
		return
	}

	layout := "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
	timeStr := "2025-03-24 14:45:00"

	parsedTime, err := time.ParseInLocation(layout, timeStr, location)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Parsed time:", parsedTime)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use the standard reference date (Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006) for defining layouts accurately.
- Replace hard-coded time zones with `time.LoadLocation` for better adaptability and maintainability.
- Always handle parsing errors to prevent potential issues with unexpected input.

## Common Pitfalls

- Incorrectly setting the format string, leading to unmatched parsing attempts.
- Ignoring parsing errors, which can lead to silent failure and incorrect data handling.
- Assuming UTC by default when the input might represent a local time zone.

## Performance Tips

- Re-use parsed `Location` objects from `time.LoadLocation` to avoid unnecessary processing.
- Profile time parsing in performance-sensitive applications, especially when dealing with large batches of time strings.
- Pre-validate string formats if possible to minimize parsing errors and improve efficiency.
